# Vite template builder to quickly generate 2D shaders in the browser.

This repository will help create custom 2D shaders quickly using the [OGL](https://github.com/oframe/ogl) library, a small, effective WebGL library. It is powered by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/why.html) ⚡️ that quickly compiles anything you need, it is also including [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/guide), [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), [Eslint](https://eslint.org/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), [lil-gui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lil-gui) and [GSAP](https://greensock.com/docs/) for animations.
